    "* Write your program in a Python cell just under each question.\n",
    "* You can write an explanation of your solution as comments in your code.\n",
    "* You should work with the two data files (VostokStation.txt and last_months_earthquakes.csv) in their original form. They must **not** be modified.\n",
    "* In each case your solution program must fulfil all of the instructions - please check the instructions carefully and double check that your program fulfils all of the given instructions.\n",
    "* Save your work regularly.\n",
    "* At the end of the test you should email your IPython notebook document (i.e. this document) to [Gerard J. Gorman](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/g.gorman) at g.gorman@imperial.ac.uk"
